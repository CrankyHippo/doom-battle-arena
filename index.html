        <h2>Story & Origins</h2>
        <p class="section-sub">
          Battle Arena is a UAC black-ops facility and as a passion project
          built over years of late-night Doom co-op.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>In-Universe: UAC Battle Research Center</h3>
            <p>
              The Battle Arena is a secret Union Aerospace Corporation complex
              on Earth. Its purpose: capture and study creatures discovered via
              ancient teleporters on Mars' moons then throw elite Marines at
              them until someone learns something or dies trying.
            </p>
            <p>
              The facility is split between a biological research wing, packed
              with caged monsters and the Arena itself, where live-fire tests
              pit Marines against demonic hordes. Safety is “a top priority”, at
              least according to the welcome briefing you get before stepping
              into a building full of teleporters, experimental power systems,
              and a room filled to the brim with monsters. What could possibly
              go wrong?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Real-World: Two High-School Doom Nerds</h3>
            <p>
              Battle Arena started life around 2002-2004 when Alex “Anelf3”
              Gumpel and Bryan “CrankyHippo” Burnett tried to recreate their
              favorite Doom II memory: sprinting past a Cyberdemon that slowly
              crept closer to the spawn every time they died.
            </p>
            <p>
              The original prototype was just a giant pit full of Cyberdemons
              and a central bunker. From there the level grew organically:
              control room, exterior courtyard, brig, armory, med bay,
              maintenance shafts, and a spawn zone where players choose how to
              enter the map.
            </p>

      <!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
      <section id="how-to-play">
        <h2>How to Play & Roles</h2>
        <p class="section-sub">
          Battle Arena shines when players adopt loose roles and lean into the
          scenarios: a normal day at work, sudden containment failures, and
          full-scale demon outbreaks.

                <strong>Marines</strong> spawn at the front entrance or directly
                in the Arena, gear up in the Armory, and fight demons until
                they're out of blood or ammo. They're the stars of the show in
                the Arena.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Workers / Scientists</strong> keep the place running:
                starting at the entrance or Control Room, watching Marines from
                behind glass, running to Engineering or Medical, or occasionally
                picking up a gun when things go bad.

                <strong>SWAT</strong> is only called when something has gone
                very wrong: monsters loose in the corridors, a Marine snapping
                into “space madness”, or a BRIG malfunction. They use a red
                keycard to access a private SWAT entrance and high-speed
                elevator into the maintenance shafts.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Normal Day at Work</strong> - Everyone spawns via the
              front entrance, checks in at Security, hits the Armory, and then
              activates the Arena from the main bunker. Retreat to Medical and
              restock when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Containment Failure</strong> - The BRIG cells open and
              demons spill into the main corridor. Workers dive into maintenance
              shafts; Marines & SWAT scramble to seal the area and clear the
              base.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Space Madness</strong> - One Marine “snaps” and becomes a
              hostile player. Workers hide and track them on cameras while SWAT
              hunts them through the shafts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cyberdemon Loose in the Base</strong> - Boss-tier
              emergency. Bunkers, teleports, and SWAT entrance all come into
              play while everyone tries not to get vaporized.
